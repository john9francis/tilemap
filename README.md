# tilemap
Goals for this project:
* Create a TileMap class
* This class will have several tiles with individual textures
* There will be another class called Chunk that arranges something like 20x20 tiles
* Each tile will have a hitbox so the eventual player doesn't fall through it
* The TileMap will have a couple types: level, or infinite, procedurally generated or designed
